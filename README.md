# Task manager

A great and simple tool with which you can keep some information in a shape of cards inside columns. You can drag columns and drop it to other columns.

There are a lot of real world examples, when you may need it. Some of them:
 - Manage process flow: "In progress", "Review", "Done"
 - Handle different data: "To do in the morning", "To do at night".
